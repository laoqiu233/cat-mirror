# Cat-Mirror - REMASTERED🐈
## Modular Smart Mirror System written using Flask + Electron
**🚧THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS🚧**

## About

Cat-Mirror is about simplicity, so that the user can easily create any kind of module they want without writing too much code. 
The current version of Cat-Mirror requires the user to write a bunch of redundent code in both Python and JavaScript. 

The remastered version is aimed to offer user a simpler experience writing modules. Using web sockets and Vue.js, the remastered version will allow the user to create a working module without writing too much JavaScript.

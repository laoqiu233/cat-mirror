# Headlines Module
This module uses the [news api](https://newsapi.org/) to get fresh articles and display them on the mirror.

## Configuration
First, you need to create an account on the [news api website](https://newsapi.org/). You can use a developer subscription plan.

Then, enter your account page, copy your api key, then open the `/modules/headlines/module.py` file and paste it on the line `apikey = ''` between the quotation marks.

After that, you can further customize what kind of articles you want to see on your mirror. Read the comments in the `module.py` file to learn more.
